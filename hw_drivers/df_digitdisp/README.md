Wiki: https://wiki.dfrobot.com/4-Digital%20LED%20Segment%20Display%20Module%20%20SKU:%20DFR0645-G_DFR0645-R


Voltage: 5VDC (confirmed 3V3 also works)
Interface: I2C (**not I2C** despite false advertising from DFRobot)
            uses a very annoying non-addressable digital I/O, and you can only send commands via some hybrid of binary data and pulse width modulation
            **very annoying - do not recommend this product**
