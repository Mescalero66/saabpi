*Voltage: 5VDC (confirmed 3V3 also works)
*Interface: I2C (**not I2C** despite false advertising from DFRobot)

            uses a very annoying non-addressable digital I/O, and you can only send commands via some hybrid of binary data and pulse width modulation

            **very annoying - do not recommend this product**
