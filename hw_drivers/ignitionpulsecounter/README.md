> If on 1986 and 1987 models, all electrical checks are as specified but the car still does not start, check the **ignition pulse amplifier** on the main fuse relay panel.
See Fig. 12. 
This relay-like amplifier is designed to "amplify" the tachometer signal for more reliable control of electronic components affected by the ignition system (LH fuel injection, fuel pump control, etc.).
